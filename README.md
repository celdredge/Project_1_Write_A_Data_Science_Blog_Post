# Project_1_Write_A_Data_Science_Blog_Post

## Motivation for project

This analysis focused on a subset of the Stack Overflow survey dataset of nondevelopers working in Data Science, looking at the following questions:

1. What portion of data scientists have advanced degrees?
2. What portion of data scientists use SQL, Python, and R?
3. How well can we predict data scientist's job satisfaction based on their career satisfactions, hours worked per week, and Stack overflow satisfaction?
4. Of these factors, what most affected job satisfaction?

## Libraries used

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn
- re

## Files in the repository
- Stack Overflow Data Analysis.ipynb - this file is a Jupyter notebook containing the code used for data analysis and modeling
- README.md - this file with an overview of the project

## Summary of the results

- Nearly 54% of data scientists had advanced degrees, either a Masters or Doctoral degree
- Python was the most common programming language among data scientists in the survey; ~48% of data scientists that responded to the survey used Python
- Career satisfaction drove job satisfaction; about 44% of the variation in the job satisfaction was explained by the model
